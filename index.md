Welcome to the ДДºCrew Bar,
On behalf of the leader of ДДºCrew MK4VR6GTI and my family here at ДДºCrew I would like to welcome you. Welcome
you to a gaming experience unlike any other. ДДºCrew is a family of friends created and maintained by people 
from all over the world. Friends who have found a common bond with each other and desire to enjoy gaming at a 
different level. If you have come this far be prepared. Behind these walls is a family that decided long ago that
we were not going to play the way society told us to. We are going to enjoy the game the way WE want to. I warn
you ДДºCrew is not for everyone but whether you were invited, just curious, or want to make a complaint feel free
to enjoy the server. Remember drinks are always on the house.
